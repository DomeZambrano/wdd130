        <p>Hello! My name is Alisson Zambrano and I am from Riobamba, Ecuador.
            I really enjoy listening to music from my favorite artist while I do my tasks. <br/>
            I have two brothers, one older and one younger sister, I like to spend a lot of time with them while I am at home, we also have a dog called "Linda" we adopted her from the street and now she has a lot of time with us.<br/>
            I love being in this class learning about developing web pages. 
            I hope to understand all the classes and get good grades.
            My favorite singer in the world is Adele, 
            I really love listening to music but her lyrics create feelings that sometimes you think you let go unnoticed, they are present there waiting to be observed and analyzed.<br/>
            My favorite food is the famous encebollado that exists in my country, I love the mountains and nature, the beautifully colored flowers and enjoying every corner of my beautiful country.</p>

        <img src="images/Ecuador.png" alt="Ecuador, my country">
        <p>Ecuador is the most compact megadiverse country in the world. In Ecuador, we have all four worlds at the same time: we have the marine Coast, the Andean Sierra, the eastern jungle, and the marvelous Insular wonder of the Galapagos Islands.</p>
